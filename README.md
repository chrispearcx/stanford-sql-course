# SQL Movie-Rating Query Exercises
You've started a new movie-rating website, and you've been collecting data on reviewers' ratings of various movies. There's not much data yet, but you can still try out some interesting queries. Here's the schema: 

Movie ( mID, title, year, director ) 
English: There is a movie with ID number mID, a title, a release year, and a director. 

Reviewer ( rID, name ) 
English: The reviewer with ID number rID has a certain name. 

Rating ( rID, mID, stars, ratingDate ) 
English: The reviewer rID gave the movie mID a number of stars rating (1-5) on a certain ratingDate. 

Your queries will run over a small data set conforming to the schema. [View the database](https://lagunita.stanford.edu/c4x/DB/SQL/asset/moviedata.html). (You can also [download the schema and data](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/prod-c2g/db/Winter2013/files/rating.sql).)

**Instructions:** Each problem asks you to write a query in SQL. When you click "Check Answer" our back-end runs your query against the sample database using SQLite. It displays the result and compares your answer against the correct one. When you're satisfied with your solution for a given problem, click the "Submit" button to check your answer.  

**Important Notes:**

* Your queries are executed using SQLite, so you must conform to the SQL constructs supported by SQLite.
* Unless a specific result ordering is asked for, you can return the result rows in any order.
* You are to translate the English into a SQL query that computes the desired result over all possible databases. All we actually check is that your query gets the right answer on the small sample database. Thus, even if your solution is marked as correct, it is possible that your query does not correctly reflect the problem at hand. (For example, if we ask for a complex condition that requires accessing all of the tables, but over our small data set in the end the condition is satisfied only by Star Wars, then the query "select title from Movie where title = 'Star Wars'" will be marked correct even though it doesn't reflect the actual question.) Circumventing the system in this fashion will get you a high score on the exercises, but it won't help you learn SQL. On the other hand, an incorrect attempt at a general solution is unlikely to produce the right answer, so you shouldn't be led astray by our checking system.

You may perform these exercises as many times as you like, so we strongly encourage you to keep working with them until you complete the exercises with full credit.
